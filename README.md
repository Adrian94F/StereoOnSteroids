# Stereo On Steroids
My master thesis POC about possibilities of speeding up stereo vision (generating depth map) based on OpenCV library.

# TODO
- Calibration (2/3)
  - Extrinsic calibration
  - Undistortion and rectification
- Depth map generation
- Speeding up

# Done
- Collecting images from cameras
- Calibration (1/3)
  - Intrinsic calibration
